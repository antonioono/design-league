                    <meta property="og:description" content="This summer I&#8217;m a Product Design Intern at Facebook, and I have a pretty unorthodox FB internship experience: I am based in the NYC office (instead of at Facebook&#8217;s headquarters), I work on something that&#8217;s not part of the core Facebook product, and I worked out of the London office for part of the summer.



 I think I got a pretty sweet deal.







 Facebook flew me out to Menlo Park for the first two weeks for design bootcamp, and then flew me out to London again in the beginning of July because our whole team decided to work from that office. So I&#8217;ve had quite a bit of traveling with this internship.







 The best part about being in the NYC office is being in the city. Whereas the Menlo Park campus is filled with cafes and restaurants and fun and games, the FBNY office is sort of like a shelter from the hustle and bustle of the city. In Menlo Park, teams don&#8217;t really go &#8220;out&#8221; for lunch or dinner. They go to one of the many food places on campus. But here, it feels like we have lunches and dinners and drinks every week&#8212;out in all the best locations in New York.







 I got a similar feeling from the London office, too. The office itself is a lot shinier and nicer, though, as seems to be the case with everything in London. For the two weeks, our team stayed in a war room, which is a conference room set up with desks and monitors so visiting people can have a place to sit and so the team can all be in the same location.







 My team moves pretty fast in working, especially because we&#8217;re not part of the core Facebook product. We actually just pushed something out last week for internal dogfooding (meaning for other Facebook employees to use and test and give feedback) and it was really interesting to see the kind of feedback people gave, and to be part of the process of refining our work based on that feedback. I&#8217;ve never had that experience previously because nothing that I&#8217;ve worked on during an internship has been launched before the internship ended, and it&#8217;s definitely not the kind of thing that class projects allow you to experience either.



 My favorite thing about working at Facebook is that they really support your growth as a designer. In the words of my roommate, they &#8216;do everything to help you succeed.&#8217; Nowhere else have I experienced this kind of trust and support&#8212;they let you present your work to stakeholders, they trust your design judgment when a decision needs to be made, and they let you work on important projects that get released. In addition to all that, they give you valuable feedback as you go, not just on your design work, but on how you can be a better designer.







 Something that&#8217;s been really valuable to me during this internship is all the high-level product discussions that I get to participate in. It&#8217;s difficult, and different, to think about design in terms of product strategy and it&#8217;s really helpful to hear all the intelligent opinions and perspectives everyone has. People really get worked up about these decisions sometimes.







 I knew before coming to Facebook that they had a number of exceptional designers. I can now sort of see how they got there&#8212;the company definitely not only spawns and grows great products, but also fosters the growth of people. Over the past summers I slowly realized the importance of a good mentor, and it&#8217;s really amazing seeing how my mentor/manager this summer helps me become a better designer (oh, and he&#8217;s a CMU alum!). It&#8217;s not just him, either. I get an indirect sense of what his manager is like because we have a lot of crits and discussions together, and it confirms the fact that Facebook cultivates people. Good mentors and good designers.">
