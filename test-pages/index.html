I&rsquo;m Kevin, a rising senior in the communications track. This summer I interned at Wunderman NY, an advertising agency that focuses on design driven by creativity and data.</p><p>Check out their website: <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wunderman.com%2F&amp;t=Y2QwMzdhMWI1MmM0NDliODcyNGEzNzEwMGIzOWIxZGIxNjQwNDA0Yyw2eVVZTVpsUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3As9mu6S8B294K7N_Q7g4r-A&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fcmudesignleague.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F164465487696%2Fkevinwunderman&amp;m=1" target="_blank">www.wunderman.com</a></p><p>Their Instagram: <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fwunderman_ny%2F&amp;t=ZTlmM2Q2NWIzZjljNTZmNDhjZjUwZmJjMjEwNjkyY2VmNGY1MGU0Yyw2eVVZTVpsUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3As9mu6S8B294K7N_Q7g4r-A&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fcmudesignleague.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F164465487696%2Fkevinwunderman&amp;m=1" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/wunderman_ny/</a></p><p>After finishing my junior year at CMU, I knew I wanted to intern at an advertising agency because I was interested in the variety of projects they worked on. Ad agencies tend to have many clients that vary from one another and I thought this experience would give me a better idea on possible future careers.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="1600"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/a8eca4221acaa2c19799f153078d038f/tumblr_inline_ov2bauYAi91r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="1600" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>[Wunderman sign]</p><p><b>The Story:</b></p><p>This was my first professional internship experience. I had heard from my older friends about what they went through and what to expect, but I also had an agenda of my own that I wanted to accomplish over this short summer. Beyond learning more about design, I wanted to polish my work ethic as well as build social capital. Coming from Los Angeles, I was fortunate that I would be in the New York Wunderman office, the perfect environment to truly have a taste of the professional design world before the fall semester would quickly approach.</p><p>However, my excitement to begin was quickly crushed as I was overwhelmed by the fast paced life style of the New Yorkers and the strict 40+ hour weeks. The sticky summer humidity would have been more bearable if my &ldquo;affordable summer housing&rdquo; had functioning A/C.</p><p>I wish I could say it was easy transitioning from a school schedule where you could take naps and skip classes into a deadline-based work schedule that leaves little room for relaxation. I thought I was going to enjoy the city of New York on weekends and enjoy all the tourist locations, but I quickly realized my exhaustion from work overcame my sense of adventure.</p><p>It may have sounded pretty miserable , but I quickly adapted and soon learned to enjoy this grind. I worked in a team of thirteen interns. Five of us were creatives and the rest were strategy and project manager roles. One of Wunderman&rsquo;s strengths was the interdisciplinary team. We were put in a setting where all of us were doing the research for our brief and collaborating together even though we all came from varying backgrounds and had different disciplines. This helped the team gain a stronger perspective on our brief/projects and led us to many unique solutions for our tasks.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1188" data-orig-width="1180"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/6ce8c975fa31d43368c84a1d09f6d6d6/tumblr_inline_ov2bhjK9us1r2ht38_500.png" data-orig-height="1188" data-orig-width="1180" width="500" height="503"></figure><p>[Rooftop]</p><p><b>The Work:</b></p><p>I was the visual design intern for our group. The other 4 &ldquo;creatives&rdquo; included the graphic designer, copywriter, art director, and UX designer. Although I may have been given the role &ldquo;visual designer,&rdquo; I worked as if I was all 5 roles combined.</p><p>All 13 of us interns worked on one client brief for the whole summer. It was process where we came up with different campaign ideas to solve a central problem that the client would introduce. In the ad world, we present data and research that supports our solution, show the solution in real world scenarios, and explain why this solution is useful for the target audience. Throughout each of these steps, we met with mentors and executives who would critique our ideas and challenge us to think in different directions.</p><p>I learned a lot about advertising agencies and how they treat design. I have mixed feelings about this but basically their highest priority is what sells, not necessarily what may be the best design option. 50% of what I presented at the final client presentation was the content itself (concepts, reasonings, data) and the other 50% was how I delivered that message (public speaking). I developed a lot as an individual because this forced me to overcome one of my biggest fears: presenting in front of people. We had to present every other day to many designers and clients, who were spending real money to either buy our idea or ditch it. I learned very quickly how to answer questions under pressure and how to remain calm and composed.</p><p>Confidence comes from preparation. The more I practiced and the more I was familiar with our concept, the less concerned I was with my stage fright, and the more excited I was to present our ideas.</p><p>There were many late nights in the office where all five of us creative interns were frustrated beyond belief thinking of clever taglines, the purpose behind our design, and other things that just question your sanity as a designer. But it was all worth it because we all felt so accomplished and proud of what we created. While the exact details of what we worked on need to remain confidential, I can proudly say that our client bought our idea and will implement it in the near future!</p><p><b>The People:</b></p><p>Not only is the work you are doing important, but the people you surround yourself with are just as vital. You spend most of your weekdays with the people you work with and you want to be around those who are just as passionate as you are and friendly in the working environment. I really enjoyed working with such a large group of interns because we all got along and we solved a lot of our issues through honest and real communication. I think a healthy work environment consists of a combination of hard work, collaboration, and a few laughs.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1348" data-orig-width="1346"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/d7c494707d645bf1db7dd0a3d02affd8/tumblr_inline_ov2blsXNXy1r2ht38_500.png" data-orig-height="1348" data-orig-width="1346" width="500" height="500"></figure><p>[Central Park Break]</p><p><b>The Conclusion:</b></p><p>Ultimately, this summer was my hardest summer ever. However, it was also definitely my most rewarding and an experience incomparable to anything else. I learned so much about advertising, the professional world, and even about myself as an individual. I know I&rsquo;ve grown for the better after this summer and it has given me a completely new perspective on the world of design.</p><p>The most important thing I am taking from this is a better work ethic. I can honestly say I took school for granted and didn&rsquo;t work as hard as I could have these past 3 years. My love for design prevailed during this summer and helped me develop a new found appreciation for what I study. After this experience, I am so much more thankful for being in such an amazing design program at CMU and will apply this new profound work ethic into my last year here.</p><p>Thank you and I hope you guys enjoyed reading about my experience this summer!</p><p>Feel free to message me if you have questions or just want to talk about anything design related, advertising related, personal growth related!!</p><p>Email: kevingao@andrew.cmu.edu</p></section><footer><ul class="meta"><li class="tags toggle"><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/CMU">CMU</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/design">design</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/visual-design">visual design</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/Wunderman">Wunderman</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/intern">intern</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/design-at-work">design at work</a></li></ul></li></ul></footer></article><article id="post-164464696146" class="post text  tag_NAVER tag_Line tag_Naver+Green+Factory tag_South+Korea tag_CMU tag_Design tag_CMU+Design tag_design+at+work tag_UX tag_UI "><header><author><a href="http://sea-mylife.tumblr.com/" style="background-image: url('http://78.media.tumblr.com/avatar_d6db6f6dd2ee_96.png')">

They were interning to get hired at the end of the internship while we were more of a learning and experience internship.&nbsp;</p><p>Bori and I were assigned to one team and one project for the entire 10 weeks while the others intern for 8 weeks with 2 projects. Bori and I were assigned one mentor originally (UX Design), but by the end of week 10, we basically had 6 (4 UX, 2 UI). Everyone involved in the project genuinely wanted to help us out(:&nbsp;<i>It was my first time actually implementing the design thinking that we learn in the classroom and considered UI to that extent.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>During the 9th week, the CEO wanted the design interns and the service interns to work on a week long project in groups of 4-5. I do think that this week was one of the more packed, but enjoyable weeks! It was interesting to work with people of a different mindset than designers. The most difficult part for me was probably language. Everything was done in Korean, so a little translating hamster was working nonstop in my brain.&nbsp;</p><figure data-orig-width="3264" data-orig-height="2448" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/51d71f869dc9379dbd142f0df01289bc/tumblr_inline_ov00zuTgVO1r2ht38_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3264" data-orig-height="2448" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>[My week long team: Hyeryeong, Gahee, Kyungil, Kyungjin]&nbsp;</p><p><b>NAVER&nbsp;</b></p><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/8c83ca968782113b73a3aef198aaddfb/tumblr_inline_ov01g4Mws31r2ht38_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" width="500" height="666"></figure><p>I worked at NAVER&rsquo;s headquarters: Naver Green Factory.

My residence was in Pangyo, a short 20 minutes from Gangnam in Seoul. If I ever made dinner plans, it was almost always at 8pm, Gangnam Station, Exit 11. It was tiring to have post work plans on the weekdays, so every weekend I tried to make the best of my time. I went to Seoul almost every weekend and went to places such as Hongdae, Gangnam, Garusogil, Jamsil, DDP, etc. I even went on a weekend trip to the coast city of Busan with a few friends from school! The city never seems to sleep! Especially in the summertime, there were numerous concerts going on + small vacation opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Summary</b></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="270" data-orig-width="480" style=""><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/859f2c648c65a517418fd8a30909ba7c/tumblr_inline_ov02pfmv0U1r2ht38_500.gif" data-orig-height="270" data-orig-width="480" width="480" height="270"></figure><p>Overall, I thought that interning at NAVER was a really good learning experience. Although I had to adjust and understand a lot of small cultural differences, my experience there was unforgettable thanks to the wonderful mentors and friends that helped guide my way. I learned a lot of classroom to workplace application that would&rsquo;ve been hard to understand without work experience. I&rsquo;m glad I was lucky enough to intern at NAVER this summer and I&rsquo;ll miss all the friendly faces I&rsquo;ve met on the way.&nbsp;</p></section><footer><ul class="meta"><li class="tags toggle"><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/NAVER">NAVER</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/Line">Line</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/Naver-Green-Factory">Naver Green Factory</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/South-Korea">South Korea</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/CMU">CMU</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/Design">Design</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/CMU-Design">CMU Design</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/design-at-work">design at work</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/UX">UX</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/UI">UI</a></li></ul></li></ul></footer></article><article id="post-164411866211" class="post text  tag_CMU tag_Design tag_DesignLeague tag_Summer tag_Intern tag_Samsung tag_Cameron tag_Samsung+Research+America tag_Think+Tank+Team "><header><author><a href="http://sea-mylife.tumblr.com/" style="background-image: url('http://78.media.tumblr.com/avatar_d6db6f6dd2ee_96.png')">

My name&rsquo;s Cameron, I&rsquo;m currently a rising junior in the Environments track. This past summer I worked at Samsung Research America on the Think Tank Team in Mountain View, California. TTT (as it&rsquo;s known for short) is an atypical R&amp;D team charged with developing concepts and prototypes for future products and technologies; the team is composed of an extremely diverse group of people across design, engineering, and the sciences. Just to name a few, I worked alongside software engineers, mechanical engineers, optical engineers, physicists and solid-state chemistry people, electrical engineers, photographers and filmmakers, and a whole myriad of visual, motion, and interaction designers. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen as many different types of work going on in one room as I did at TTT.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1005" data-orig-width="1340"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/fd7f2cb524af2824640f5fc747864932/tumblr_inline_ouzvymNYLz1r2ht38_500.png" data-orig-height="1005" data-orig-width="1340" width="500" height="375"></figure><p><i>The Think Tank Team is located on the 3rd floor and has ~60 members: inside four semi-distinct labs work together: Tomorrow Lab, Interaction Studio, Pixel Lab, and Computer Vision Lab.</i></p><p><b>So what did I do, you might ask?</b></p><p>Well, I&rsquo;m not allowed to say much besides that &lsquo;I worked on new candidate designs and prototypes for future Samsung smartphones.&rsquo; Instead of talking about the work I&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about TTT&rsquo;s process and what it was like working on an R&amp;D team inside a huge South Korea-based company.</p><p>Firstly, TTT delivers many different types of work to HQ: we make concept videos, we invent new sensing technologies, we explore novel interactions and new UX, test industrial design possibilities and create proof-of-concept hardware, create new display technologies, and more. This breadth of abilities means that some projects will have multiple components being developed simultaneously, so one group of people might be building a software prototype while another is building a hardware prototype with experimental tech. Even though the future vision (and concept video) has both of these prototypes integrated into one product at some future date, it can often make sense to incubate these pieces separately for a time.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1512" data-orig-width="2016"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/d5d6f7cd236449b6b29d1c1dee9107cc/tumblr_inline_ouzvz860Ly1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="1512" data-orig-width="2016" width="500" height="375"></figure><p><i>Showing my co-worker a prototype (blurred out for confidentiality).</i></p><p>Before I go into a bit of culture and description of corporate scale &mdash; here&rsquo;s some context, last summer I worked at an internet startup of ~200 people (all of whom worked in one office) called Asana. Working at Samsung, from a scale and culture perspective, was a <i>totally</i>different beast. To start, Samsung Electronics employs over 300,000 people worldwide &mdash; just looking at R&amp;D centers, ours was just one of 23 worldwide (the count increases to almost 40 if you count design centers) and this doesn&rsquo;t even begin to describe the massiveness and multiplicity of teams at HQ. When Pranav, TTT&rsquo;s Head, would retell the numerous visits he would make on a trip to HQ in our weekly stand-ups, it was hard to keep straight &mdash; even the concept of HQ became murky as he described traveling to different cities and campuses. All of this underscores the importance of communication and collaboration required to make TTT&rsquo;s concepts and prototypes come to fruition.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1316" data-orig-width="2578"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/59e7aebc01120ca4b76177b735188fa5/tumblr_inline_ouzvzpUBPM1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="1316" data-orig-width="2578" width="500" height="255"></figure><p><i>&lsquo;The Dojo&rsquo; is pictured above: executives, workshops with collaborating teams from HQ, and visitors from Global TTT (our sister lab in South Korea) were hosted here during my time.

Within the Maelstrom, we both held the title of User Experience (UX) designers, but both dabbled in the roles of visual design and design research.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="720" data-orig-width="960"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/d883863d0a59ce67bf3edd3789fde68c/tumblr_inline_ouyobkzrCQ1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="720" data-orig-width="960" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>IBM was founded over 100 years ago and has always revolved around invention, innovation, and breaking the status quo. About 3 years ago, IBM decided that design was an integral part of these processes, and converted several of the IBM locations into design studios. Currently, the largest design studio is in Austin, Texas. In the Austin campus, there are around 3 full floors that have been designated specifically for design. The Maelstrom has its own studio on one of these floors, and is in the center of around 10 other product teams, allowing us to see projects being worked on and to overhear critiques and conversations.</p><p>We began working in our shorter project&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the &ldquo;Nanoproject&rdquo;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;for two weeks. But moving quickly wasn&rsquo;t the hard part, not when you&rsquo;re in a 15 person group. It was pretty chaotic, but working with so many people was intentionally part of the challenge. After we made our final presentation, we were split into three different teams of five. (Sara Remi and I were working on separate teams) Each team was working on a different problem and was given different expectations so it was pretty cool to see what everyone was up to on our weekly presentations. By the end, we are all expected to give our final one to the IBM Design executives, so there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="799"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/5b34e56ce0456692047944be7c380358/tumblr_inline_ouyocyEwmb1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="799" width="500" height="667"></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="799"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/bcaca773cd4195d3c0c2ea35dbf42d0e/tumblr_inline_ouyocpGoSp1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="799" width="500" height="667"></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="799"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/2546ffc23a4a6e41b5a24f7697fd2674/tumblr_inline_ouyoczYFph1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="799" width="500" height="667"></figure><p>Outside of the office, we have had time to explore both downtown Austin and some of the surround suburbia.

With an average temperature of 100 degrees each day, though, it has been hard to see as much as the outdoors as we would like, and it is super important to keep hydrated.<br></p></section><footer><ul class="meta"><li class="tags toggle"><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/Design">Design</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/UX">UX</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/UI">UI</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/IBM">IBM</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/CMU">CMU</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/designleague">designleague</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/austin">austin</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/Texas">Texas</a></li></ul></li></ul></footer></article><article id="post-164388292436" class="post text  tag_design tag_ux tag_cmu tag_Asana tag_san+francisco "><header><author><a href="http://sea-mylife.tumblr.com/" style="background-image: url('http://78.media.tumblr.com/avatar_d6db6f6dd2ee_96.png')">

The comms design team works primarily on marketing and brand work for Asana. The product design team is distributed across all of Asana&rsquo;s core product teams (task pane, track anything, mobile, etc.) with normally 1&ndash;2 designers per team&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the Product Designers all sit with their respective product teams. Designers from both roles often go to each other&rsquo;s crits (product critique and marketing critique) and we have group design events 1&ndash;2 times a week where we share inspiration and talk about design stuff in general.<br></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="652" data-orig-width="800"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/efb38fe1bd82e43345f51102e3a3e718/tumblr_inline_ouyo5t2Ax11r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="652" data-orig-width="800" width="500" height="407"></figure><p>(one group design team activity was a Terrarium building workshop&rdquo;]</p><p>In comparison to my first-year at CMU, one of the biggest surprises was the reduced frequency of critique. Instead of having crit. everyday, I normally had a group product critique once a week. To offset this, Asana also has something called Micro Critique where the designer makes an Asana task with the work attached and a brief description of the type of feedback desired, then they assign sub-tasks to three other Designers, Product Managers, or User Researchers to receive quick on-the-fly feedback.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/af88c70e62e450d06aed8577aca161c6/tumblr_inline_ouyo6oxpTb1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>(my workstation (sketch artboards airbrushed out for confidentiality))</p><p><b>Culture at Asana</b></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="430" data-orig-width="1600"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/6d9525ad934454943171ff6886b4b246/tumblr_inline_ouyo7esJVF1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="430" data-orig-width="1600" width="500" height="134"></figure><p>(the whole company gathered for Asana&rsquo;s annual summer celebration event)</p><p>Asana is a medium sized startup with approximately 220 full time employees and 20 interns for the summer. Asana provides lunch, breakfast, and dinner everyday, so most people get to the office for breakfast around 9:30AM and leave after dinner around 6:45PM. The office culture is vibrant and some people stay after dinner to hang out, chat, and play board games (GO, in particular, is popular).</p><p>In terms of culture, Asana places a large emphasis on mindfulness and transparency. That may sound clich&eacute; (trust me, it did to me at first too), but after spending a few weeks there, it proved quite true. Everyone within the company has certain AORs (Areas of Responsibility) and the organizational structure is designed such that the people closest to the work are both &lsquo;responsible for&rsquo; and &lsquo;enabled to&rsquo; make decisions on those AORs.</p><p>Furthermore, almost all of Asana&rsquo;s internal information (including AOR assignments, Key Results for different products, and Company Objectives) is tracked in asana the tool and made transparent and viewable by everyone in the company&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;this makes it feel like you can see what&rsquo;s going on within any group in the company at any time.</p><p><b>Living in San Francisco</b><br></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/e18871ff76e671f148700af5b07e4b01/tumblr_inline_ouyo81E12E1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>Summarizing what it&rsquo;s like to live in San Francisco isn&rsquo;t easy. The way I have frequently explained it to friends and family afar is with a simple idea: &ldquo;Imagine the most contrast (social, economic, colour, texture, etc.) you could see in one visual frame, that&rsquo;s SF!&rdquo; What I mean by that is that you will see google buses rolling down the street next to people selling books on a blanket next to people sleeping in tents next to yuppie interns walking with tech company branded backpacks next to you name it all in one glance. This is difficult to describe, but is easy to understand once experienced. The &lsquo;glances of contrast&rsquo; I see walking around San Francisco continue to astonish me, every single day.</p><p><b>Summary</b></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="450" data-orig-width="600"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/973c6e369ad086e95adeb6d88b095fbf/tumblr_inline_ouyo8uU4eJ1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="450" data-orig-width="600" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>(Rameez Remsudeen (left) and Karthik Raju, my partners at Greylock Hackfest)<br></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="450" data-orig-width="600"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/56a6caf64236b9ba40ab7c43b55af125/tumblr_inline_ouyo9thRvR1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="450" data-orig-width="600" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>(Madea, KPCB partner and former President of RISD, at a #DesignInTech Event)</p><p>I&rsquo;m throughly grateful for having been able to spend my summer at Asana.

When I first received this opportunity, I was extremely worried that I was going to be stranded and bored in the middle of nowhere, Michigan (since I didn&rsquo;t know how to drive)&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but it actually has been one of the best summers ever!</p><p>A lot of you may not be interested in the automotive field at all, and trust me, I was the same, but ever since being here I have realized how much potential there is for User Experience design within this field. Everyone is looking forward to the &lsquo;connected lifestyle&rsquo; that we are going to have in the future, and to have that kind of connectivity, the car is going to have to be at the center of that experience.</p><p>(Check out this cool video by Nissan if you have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about! <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dh-TLo86K7Ck&amp;t=YWM3YWIxMzUwNjRjMzQxMmFiZGUzNmVmYzY3NmM0N2U4ZTIyN2RiNixnUk9lYU9oOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3As9mu6S8B294K7N_Q7g4r-A&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fcmudesignleague.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F164388136096%2Fpraewfiat-chrysler-automobiles&amp;m=1" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-TLo86K7Ck</a> )</p><p>Due to all this future hype and technology trends, I have attended many cool brainstorming sessions for concept cars. FCA also works in very lean teams, so they listen to everyone&rsquo;s opinions, and even as an intern, your voice could easily make an impact in ideas that go forward to the final stages!</p><p>To me, the best part of this internship was that they really respected my thoughts, and let me shape my own project so that I could work on and learn about things that I enjoy doing. I had many small side projects that exposed me to new areas of design, but I was also able to focus on something that I am interested in as my main one. Even the UI work was interesting to me, since it was in a car dashboard cluster/radio format, rather than the usual phone or web interfaces.</p><p>Apart from the work part of this internship, they also had really good programs for interns to join, like factory tours, test lab tours (HMI lab, wind tunnel etc), test ride and drives and social events with other interns in the area (Ford, GM). They also placed most of the interns in the same housing complex (in Clarkston), so it was great to be able to hang out with the other interns after work and on weekends.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="1600"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/ace088917f1c966b459a2331ea0b9723/tumblr_inline_ouynu895TU1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="1600" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>(View of Detroit from one of the apartment tours the After5 intern program took us on!)<br></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="1600"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/7e466e97b53d298534f1073248ba5573/tumblr_inline_ouynuea5VZ1r2ht38_500.jpg" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="1600" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>(Sunsets in Michigan&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;I would see this really often, just on my way home from work!)</p><p>Another part that made this summer amazing was the beautiful nature around Michigan, and the awesome people that I became really good friends with who would go on these weekly adventures with me.

Interns have a few events together such as a lecture series where we got to hear from several higher-ups like Tim Cook and Eddy Cue, Intern Games aka Apple&rsquo;s version of the hunger games, &nbsp;the App Marketing Challenge, and iContest, an intern hackathon. &nbsp;However, the intern experience is highly based on what team you&rsquo;re on, as they really treat you like an employee.&nbsp;<br></p><figure data-orig-width="3264" data-orig-height="2448" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/8d77199076a12e0a226eb10edc387479/tumblr_inline_ntz1vbrFzG1sn708j_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3264" data-orig-height="2448" width="500" height="375"></figure><p><i>obligatory main campus shot</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>I was on the iCloud Human Interface team, but more specifically the Maps HI team, which designs features in the Maps Application. &nbsp;I started interning at a really interesting time: &nbsp;the team was moving from smaller office in Cupertino to Sunnyvale, and it was just a few weeks before WWDC15. &nbsp;With WWDC came the announcement of Maps transit, a better Maps browsing interface, Swift 2, Apple Music and other features in iOS 9.0. &nbsp;</p><p><br>Aside from the new iOS 9 features, there were a lot of other aspects of Maps that I had to think about as part of the team. &nbsp;As an Apple application, it needs to exist well on multiple devices from iMacs to iPhones to Apple watches, and it has to integrate well into the different systems and relate to other applications. &nbsp;Within the app, there are so many factors including navigation, cartography, modes of transportation, and localization in maps around the world. &nbsp;With all these bits and pieces there was definitely a lot to work with. &nbsp;I loved being a part of the team because I felt I was exploring and traveling while working on projects. &nbsp; The team has to think about how the product works all over the world, so I learned a lot about landmarks, businesses, &nbsp;and transportation systems in several cities. &nbsp;It came in pretty handy when navigating around SF &ndash; I feel like I have a map of it burned into the back of my head.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width="4449" data-orig-height="1822" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/3f564ba6446a83a0500a1074ccbef904/tumblr_inline_ntz20f1sTg1sn708j_500.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="4449" data-orig-height="1822" width="500" height="204"></figure><p><i>I got to play with the apple watch! and my nametag made me feel pretty official :)</i><br></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>The team itself was an awesome group of people to work with, and I had a great time getting to know everyone. &nbsp;The office is set up similar to a studio space and we always had some kind of music playing and doodles on the whiteboards. &nbsp;It was fun to sometimes have drinks in the studio after work, play Mario Kart on the TV, or shoot the occasional nerf gun :).</p><p><br>As an intern, I got to work on a personal intern project that culminated in a presentation to other teams at Apple. &nbsp;While I did other projects for the team on the side, the intern project was the main focus of the internship. &nbsp;Apple gives you a lot of freedom with the project (as long as it relates to your team somehow), and its really up to you where you want to take it and how far you want to take it. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re really encouraged to reach out to anyone within the different teams at Apple to inform your project. &nbsp; Apple consists of so many people in different facets of their products from visual design, UX, prototyping, engineering, analytics, etc., so if I had any questions or just wanted feedback, it was always easy to find the right people. &nbsp;What I loved about working at Apple was that everyone was always happy to help out or chat about something over coffee, and it was great to learn about what other people do at the company. &nbsp;</p><p><br>There was another intern on the team that was working on a different intern project, and we worked together along with our managers extensively. &nbsp;We presented our progress every week to the entire team and it was extremely valuable to hear feedback from so many professionals that had worked with the product. Hearing everyone&rsquo;s different perspectives on our projects really got us constantly iterating on designs and thinking about every little detail. &nbsp;A huge part of the internship was spent iterating and refining the project gradually from wireframes to screenshots, but I also ended up picking up Swift and creating prototypes in Xcode. &nbsp;With so much time and freedom for the project as well as so many helpful people around you, its a great opportunity to learn different design tools and processes.</p><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/b629592bf1cdd727b5f4ecb9dba080b0/tumblr_inline_ntz2l6Lqgw1sn708j_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" width="500" height="666"></figure><p><i>pride parade in SF!</i><br></p><p><br></p><p> Aside from work, I had a lot of fun exploring SF! &nbsp;I met up with a lot of other CMU students and old friends in the city, went to the Pride Festival, saw artists at Outsidelands, and probably ate too many burritos that were the size of my head. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s always something going on in the city from food truck gatherings, Street festivals, social dancing, concerts, museum events (I could go on and on), so its impossible to get bored. &nbsp;It gets pretty cold, the hills are steep, and sometimes you pay $8 for &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; toast, but its a pretty amazing place to be. &nbsp;<br></p><figure data-orig-width="3264" data-orig-height="2448" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/a4ffc4cf97d8c7c659cee229a8f40e99/tumblr_inline_ntz235eiHU1sn708j_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3264" data-orig-height="2448" width="500" height="375"></figure><p><i>#shotoniphone6</i></p><p><br></p><p>I&rsquo;m sad that summer&rsquo;s ended so quickly, but I&rsquo;m so glad to see everyone! &nbsp;Thanks for reading and hit me up if you have any questions about Apple/SF/craigslist scams/weird ice cream flavors I tried. &nbsp;<br></p><p>-Jessica</p></section><footer><ul class="meta"><li class="tags toggle"><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/summer2015">summer2015</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/internship">internship</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/apple">apple</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/design">design</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/design-at-work">design at work</a></li><li><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/tagged/carnegie-mellon">carnegie mellon</a></li></ul></li></ul></footer></article><article id="post-127576486761" class="post text  "><header><author><a href="https://jiangtif.tumblr.com/" style="background-image: url('http://78.media.tumblr.com/avatar_02340140532a_96.png')">

Bloomberg is always a fun place to tour around because the office space is stunning and people are always bustling around going from meeting to meeting. They offer an endless amount of snacks and meals for workers, an incredible view and there are fish tanks on every floor, including a small Koi pond. The thing I loved most about Google&rsquo;s office space though is that fact that there are racks of Razor Scooters free for employees to use to get around more easily. On my own, I visited Spotify and Venmo which both provide awesome work environments. Last but not least, I got to grab lunch with Gene Hua (Senior CD) and Josh Eiten (Senior ID) at Facebook which was such a treat! </p><figure data-orig-width="1416" data-orig-height="940" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/9824d78f2d46263785808d2948fcae0a/tumblr_inline_ntmgslfDHx1s8ic29_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1416" data-orig-height="940" width="500" height="331"></figure><figure data-orig-width="4500" data-orig-height="3477" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/0f2ed8d3c04308a66c18e9ef376b3a34/tumblr_inline_ntmgt1Dvr11s8ic29_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4500" data-orig-height="3477" width="500" height="386"></figure><p><i>Pictured above: (Top left) Spotify uses strings instead of walls around the offices where possible so that there&rsquo;s 100% transparency!

This summer I was in the bay area, working as a User Experience Design Intern at LinkedIn. I was already familiar with the area so I haven&rsquo;t explored much over the summer, but I have to say&hellip; nowhere else can beat the perfect weather in California. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="1020"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/29b251b93f8d2dac6746824721395a4b/tumblr_inline_ntm2uiUmlb1tb71ce_500.png" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="1020" width="500" height="245"></figure><p>As many of you may already know, LinkedIn is a professional networking site that many people around the world use to be successful and connected with other professionals. Throughout the summer I was proud to work for a company that has a dream to create economic opportunity for everyone.<br></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="700"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/346591b434f24d447a36457e5da7044e/tumblr_inline_ntm2uuHogB1tb71ce_500.jpg" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="700" width="500" height="357"></figure><p><i>Lounge Area in Sunnyvale Office</i></p><p>What I love about LinkedIn is the culture; people are passionate about the work they do, and they know how to have fun. LinkedIn is also very diverse; there are so many people with different backgrounds and fresh perspectives, and every single employee is unique and extremely talented. It was such an honor to work closely with some very talented people in the company.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="466" data-orig-width="651"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/feb1091841763af159b57e9011a4fea6/tumblr_inline_ntm2veOuMh1tb71ce_500.png" data-orig-height="466" data-orig-width="651" width="500" height="357"></figure><p>There were four design interns including me over the summer, but every design intern worked with completely different teams. I was the only intern in my team, which was the Design Systems team.<br></p><p>To explain what Design Systems does, they focus on two big areas. The first one is brand identity, so some designers in the team design logos, color palette, typography, etc. to create patterns for all designers to use in their LinkedIn products. The second area they focus on is a much broader view of the company, like working with groups (sales, engineering, HR, etc.) that have communications needs using LinkedIn&rsquo;s brand/voice. For example, some designers in the team (like my mentor) make presentation designs for executives and communications campaigns. Generally, this side of the team makes things that talk about LinkedIn as a company. What&rsquo;s unique about this team as a whole is that they are known as the most horizontal team, and they work with almost everybody else in the company.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="500"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/0f2790dd259f730a634946fb2494dfea/tumblr_inline_ntm2vvTJeZ1tb71ce_500.jpg" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="500" width="500" height="500"></figure><p>So over the summer I&rsquo;ve been working on several different projects with this team. My job title may be UX Design Intern, but surprisingly I&rsquo;ve been doing mostly visual design stuff. I often worked on motion designs, graphic illustrations, and a little bit of branding. During the first half of the internship, I independently worked on a project that my mentor assigned, and during the second half, I contributed to a bunch of different projects that some designers in the team were working on. It was so much fun working with them side-by-side, because I learned a lot from their skills and knowledge, and they genuinely appreciated my contribution and used what I created for them. They made me feel like an important part of the team.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="700"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/0bbe950dc54391be8d44fb64aae33c57/tumblr_inline_ntm2voDLzj1tb71ce_500.jpg" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="700" width="500" height="357"></figure><p>Besides the main projects I worked on with Design Systems, I also collaborated with 14 other interns in the UED (User Experience Design) department to create an external UED recruiting website. I&rsquo;ve never worked with such a large group of people before (and I&rsquo;m sure it was the same for others as well) so it was a struggle making decisions and moving forward in the first few weeks. We were a group of design interns, web development interns, and a research intern, so we worked through the process of researching, creating content, designing, and executing the website. There&rsquo;s been a lot of disagreements, miscommunication, and unproductiveness, but after seeing the successful result, I think it was absolutely worth it, and I definitely learned a lot from this project.<br></p><p>One of the important mottos that people at LinkedIn often bring up is that relationships matter. Because of that, the UED interns had the opportunity to have lunches with the leadership team to build connections and get to know them in a casual setting. Besides the group lunches, each one of us got to have one-on-one meetings with selective leaders to ask questions and learn about what they do. The coolest opportunity though, was to &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; Steve Johnson, VP of User Experience Design, for the entire day to physically experience what his typical day is like. Thanks to him, I got to attend meetings with different design teams, learn about some products they were working on, and also, meet and shake hands with LinkedIn&rsquo;s CEO, Jeff Weiner.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="700"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/69d3bafe17e79d092a28bb5f345c15b7/tumblr_inline_ntm2w80tay1tb71ce_500.jpg" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="700" width="500" height="357"></figure><p>Of course, internship at LinkedIn is not just about work and meetings. We also had a lot of fun while we were interning, and got to attend some cool events that LinkedIn hosted for us. We had a graffiti event, formal party, design open house, paint balling, speaker series, and many more. My personal favorite was the Intern Day, when we invited our family members to the campus and show them what our work environment is like, and what projects we&rsquo;ve been working on. My parents drove to Mountain View from LA to see me, and they were super happy and proud to see where I work, and what I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p><p>One last important thing to mention about this place is that they feed us a bit too well. The food is always free; free breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The cafeteria has a variety of cuisines, so it was always a struggle to not put too much food on my plate.

I&rsquo;m Emily, a rising ED/CD sophomore. &nbsp;This summer, I had the opportunity to spend time at home while working and go on a few small adventures with some of my friends. &nbsp;I live just a little bit north of Pittsburgh so I commuted to East Liberty every day to intern with Trusst Lingerie.&nbsp;</p><figure data-orig-width="851" data-orig-height="315" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/86e8436ce590167bf43e0f8c2ab2a3e2/tumblr_inline_nteghhtv9g1tb6t8n_500.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="851" data-orig-height="315" width="500" height="185"></figure><p>Trusst Lingerie was founded when Sophia Berman (CEO) and Laura West (CPO) joined the latest cycle of Alpha Lab Gear (a startup incubator). &nbsp;They brought me on as a design intern in May as one of their first hires for the summer. &nbsp;Their cycle of Alpha Lab Gear, which lasts nine months, presented their final pitch at demo day in June. &nbsp;They are still working out of the Alpha Lab Gear offices for the next year as Alumni-in-Residence, and have expanded their company to nine people.<br></p><figure data-orig-width="2048" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/54a20a63490c11ec4e6601006bd39cf4/tumblr_inline_nteh1eIdfM1tb6t8n_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2048" data-orig-height="1024" width="500" height="250"></figure><p><i>This is the team on Demo Day. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sophia and Laura discussing future plans.</i></p><p>Sophia and Laura both graduated from CMU with Industrial Design degrees. &nbsp;Trusst, named for the &ldquo;truss&rdquo; bridge system that inspired their product, is reinventing the idea of the bra. They have&nbsp;combined patent-pending technology, luxurious fabrics, beautiful patterns, and the highest quality craftsmanship to change the way you think about lingerie. Basically, they&rsquo;re starting a&nbsp;&ldquo;bra-volution.&rdquo;</p><p>When I started working for Trusst, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to expect. But I loved (almost) every minute it. &nbsp;Laura sent me to a laundromat for a day to heat test some materials in a dryer. &nbsp;After sitting there for over 5 hours, the manager had come over to me to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t insane, I got yelled at by a customer for scaring people off and finally, some asked why I was pointing an infrared thermometer gun at my laundry. After that, I wasn&rsquo;t asked to go back to the laundromat again.</p><p>Trusst is just starting to take off as a company so they were able to give me the opportunity to try all types of design this summer:</p><p><b>Products-&nbsp;</b>Laura is Chief Products Officer (CPO) so she spends most of her time working on prototyping, creating patterns, sewing sample bras, and coordinating the sourcing of our materials. &nbsp;Earlier in the summer, I got the chance to help Laura build some of the components of the bras, as well as cut the patterns for her when she is making them.</p><p>Laura and Sophia brought on a VP of Technology, Susan. &nbsp;Her role is to understand all the scientific information behind the materials. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve gotten to help her with heat testing the materials and inputting data based on materials research.</p><figure data-orig-width="2084" data-orig-height="1334" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/d14580a1b8d39b8bc25a2e6d084f25ea/tumblr_inline_ntehvjFREA1tb6t8n_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2084" data-orig-height="1334" width="500" height="320"></figure><p><i>We did a photoshoot with the products and fruit to represent how you can compare sizes</i></p><p><b>Communications-</b>&nbsp;Trusst is planning to begin selling their product via e-commerce (pre-orders launch October 1). &nbsp;To successfully market their product, the summer has been spent coming up with ways to connect with followers through social media and email outreach.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Trusst launched a Kickstarter campaign in May that raised triple their Kickstarter goal. &nbsp;They sold over 600 products and gathered over a thousand new, interested followers. &nbsp;Most of the communication work I have been doing has focused on social media and keeping all of these people engaged.</p><figure data-orig-width="2298" data-orig-height="774" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/b43aabaca05668cd840051df02d65e4c/tumblr_inline_ntfsg4YTuw1tb6t8n_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2298" data-orig-height="774" width="500" height="168"></figure><p><i>A few examples of social media and customer outreach projects</i></p><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="2448" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/3e18cae3faea0768e8371dd00bf9a6b6/tumblr_inline_ntfrovZnRv1tb6t8n_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="2448" width="500" height="500"></figure><p><i>Fashion sketching to further investigate the different elements of each bra and how the styles look together</i></p><p><b>Environments- &nbsp;</b>When I started working for Trusst, I explained to them the new concentrations and how the program for design at CMU was structured. &nbsp;Since they are both graduates, they understand the methods and processes behind design as taught by CMU professors. &nbsp;I worked with Sophia to create projects that focused on building spaces and interactions between the company and people. &nbsp;By creating databases and providing input, I was able to establish organizational systems for the company as a way to save time.&nbsp;</p><p>This month, Trusst moved from their original office to an Alumni-in-Residence space. &nbsp;Sophia had me sketch out and create the new space for the sewing studio for Laura. &nbsp;I researched shelving and storage to effectively use the space they were given and created a rough layout using rectilinear shapes.</p><p>Since I had the opportunity to stay in Pittsburgh this summer, I was able to continue an internship that I&rsquo;ve had since the fall. &nbsp;I work as an assistant to an artist, Terry Boyd, in Lawrenceville. &nbsp;On Saturdays, I would meet him at his studio, Radiant Hall (a non-profit organization that provides a community and studio space for 80 artists), and help him create some of his larger sewn pieces. </p><figure data-orig-width="2084" data-orig-height="2084" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/d395757096032b90717cb8269437e030/tumblr_inline_ntehyjnFNf1tb6t8n_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2084" data-orig-height="2084" width="500" height="500"></figure><p><i>This is Terry Boyd // Emerging Artist for the Three Rivers Arts Festival and Best in Show Winner (2015) - below is his booth/display</i></p><p>Terry is a multi-platform artist who uses performance, pattern and fiber art, to explore the mind. His recent body of work employs both drawing and unconventional sewing techniques to create a visual &ldquo;white-noise&rdquo; that is meant to connect audiences to lost memories, forgotten dreams, and personal histories by allowing an access point to the unconsciousness. For him, the repetitive nature of the process serves as a visual mantra that triggers a meditative state. Removing the referent to the external world, these sewn abstractions guide the viewer back to the unending and elegance of the line, and invite the viewer to look inward for meaning.</p><figure data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/3e51b08fa631ef7b922434d4ed0fa3e0/tumblr_inline_ntfu7zlgBo1tb6t8n_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592" width="500" height="334"></figure><p>While working for Terry, I got to assist him in setting up a booth at the Three Rivers Arts Festival. &nbsp;The set up last until 1am but was so worth it. &nbsp;Terry was selected as an emerging artist by the festival, which provided him with a booth and enters him into the competition for Best in Show. &nbsp;I got to work at his booth on the first Saturday of the festival, right after it was announced that he had won. Three Rivers is one of my favorite things about being in Pittsburgh for the summer. &nbsp;It brings together the culture and creativity that is thriving in this city.</p><p>Being in Pittsburgh, I got to further explore the city with my friends from home. &nbsp;We attended one of the gallery crawls downtown, where my high school art teacher was featured as one of 8 painters to create a mural on a wall in a day. &nbsp;We brunched in Lawrenceville (if you haven&rsquo;t been, you have to try Coca Cafe) and went out to dinner at a local winery about 40 minutes north of the city. &nbsp;Pittsburgh usually has a few large concerts during the summer so we saw J. Cole at First Niagara Pavilion (Nicki Minaj, Wiz Khalifa, &amp; Jimmy Buffet also played at this venue over the summer).</p><figure data-orig-width="4760" data-orig-height="2388" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/bbe424393d01028bf3a61bcde97c755b/tumblr_inline_nteiklOvvf1tb6t8n_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4760" data-orig-height="2388" width="500" height="250"></figure><p><i>I took little trips along the East Coast (New York-New Jersey-Maryland), Cleveland, Niagara Falls, Chicago, &amp; Hilton Head</i></p><p>In addition to spending time in Pittsburgh, I had the opportunity to take a few trips this summer. I spent a few weekends visiting friends, exploring cities and museums, and taking a few family vacations.&nbsp;</p><p>While the summer is almost over and everyone is beginning to return to Pittsburgh, I know that I&rsquo;m happy with how the summer turned out and I hope you all did too!&nbsp;Can&rsquo;t wait to see everyone so soon and continue on with Trusst in the fall!!&nbsp;</p></section><footer><ul class="meta"></ul></footer></article></section><iframe scrolling="no" width="1" height="1" frameborder="0" style="background-color:transparent; overflow:hidden; position:absolute; top:0; left:0; z-index:9999;" id="ga_target"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">
