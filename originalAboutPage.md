<p>The CMU Design League is the AIGA and IDSA student associations united to learn, discuss and create through our design workshops, annual trips across the country and student lecture series.</p>
<p><a href="http://aiga.org/">AIGA</a>, the professional association for design, is the place design professionals turn to first to exchange ideas and information, participate in critical analysis and research, and advance education and ethical practice. Carnegie Mellon’s student chapter seeks to give Communication Design students an opportunity to learn more about the design profession as well as form national and local connections. Activities include gallery shows, movie showings, design-related fundraisers and trips to design hot spots, giving members the opportunity to explore their profession and meet new people.

<p><a href="http://www.edenweingart.com" title="Eden Weingart" target="_blank">Eden Weingart</a> <em>AIGA President/Junior</em>, I yearn to create design that brings delight and joy to people. The opportunity to use design to improve people’s lives, at any scale, excites me. I’m always seeking new knowledge and inspiration. I am a big fan of sneakers, wolves, sketching, and quality television.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.idsa.org/" target="_blank">IDSA</a>, The Industrial Designers Society of America, is a professional organization that connects designers across the United States. The Carnegie Mellon IDSA student chapter works to get aspiring designers involved in the broader professional design community. Through the organization, <a href="http://design.cmu.edu/show_program.php?s=1&amp;t=4">Industrial Design</a> students have the opportunity to interact with each other as well as with professionals in the field. Day trips, weekend adventures, and field trips to design related attractions and the annual IDSA Regional Conference give further opportunities for students to enrich their design education and get a different perspective on the professional and educational world of design. [<a href="http://design.cmu.edu/community.php?s=8" title="CMU Design">from design.cmu.edu</a>]</p>
<p><a href="http://sarahgao.com/">Sarah Gao</a> <em>IDSA President/Senior</em>, Ultimately, I aspire to create a difference through design, whether that entails fostering sustainable practices in today&#8217;s modern society, providing a service in a developing country to fulfill an otherwise neglected basic need, or inspiring others to pause and reflect on how they can make their own impact on the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.russellandrews.net" title="Russell Andrews" target="_blank">Russell Andrews</a> <em>IDSA Officer / Senior</em>, I aim to make things that I care about, no matter what form they may take. I’m always looking for opportunities that will help me become a better designer with the ultimate goal of remaining happy and inspired. That kind of rhymed.</p>
<p>Hayden Smith IDSA <em>Officer / Junior</em>, I have an insatiable desire to make things: paintings, a bike, dinner, you name it. I’m studying design (as opposed to, oh I don’t know, culinary arts) because I want my creations to inspire and improve the lives of others. Plus, chefs don’t get to use power tools.</p>

She is interested in the way people perceive and process information, and how their ability to learn may be improved by using visuals, sound, and motion to translate complex, abstract information into concrete, experiential forms.  </p>
