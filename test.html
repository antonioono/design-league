<blockquote>
<p>(via <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yulink/irene-lee-girl-detective" target="_blank">Irene Lee, Girl Detective by Yulin Kuang — Kickstarter</a>)</p>
<p>Irene Lee, Girl Detective is a short film by some Carnegie Mellon alums (and non-cmu alums, too). It only needs $175 as of writing to be fully backed on kickstarter. The film has already completed its principle photography, and funds will be used for post-production needs. The film makers are adding a voice often missing from mainstream media  - a young, female, asian protagonist. After running the film festival circuit the film makers will be releasing it online for free to reach as wide of an audience a possible.</p>
<p>All funds they receive beyond their goal will go to making post-production even more awesome, with more expensive software, licensing fees, etc. </p>
<p>I’ve backed Irene Lee, you should too!</p>

			<p>Hey vendors!</p>
<p>Thanks for being a part of the first (of many, I hope) <em><strong>SUNSMASH POP-UP SHOP</strong></em>! We are excited to have you on board - a total of 16 vendors (as of now.. there&#8217;s still 6 hours before the vendor form closes!). It&#8217;s going to be sunny and 72 degrees this Friday. It&#8217;s going to be awesome. We have some information for you vendors. It&#8217;s pretty important, so please read.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>There is a $5 entrance fee for all vendors. This helps us pay for the tables and other expenses that went into making Sunsmash. Please pay with cash on the day of the event.</span></p>
</li>
<li>Please arrive 30 minutes before the event to check-in and set up. 12:30pm!</li>
<li>
<p><span>Set a pricing structure, bring stickers or signs for prices.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>FOOD VENDORS!! If you are selling food, you need to take an online quiz. It&#8217;s quick and easy. You have to look through a power point and answer multiple choice questions. This is required by CMU&#8217;s University Center. Please do this before Friday, and send Hayden (<span>hwsmith@andrew.cmu.edu)</span>, our Vendor Coordinator, a screenshot of the last page of the quiz. </span><a href="http://www.cmu.edu/university-center/policies/foodevents/index.html" target="_blank"><span><a href="http://www.cmu.edu/university-center/policies/foodevents/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/university-center/policies/foodevents/index.html</a></span></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Payment: Transactions will be primarily cash. You can set up your own Square or Venmo if you want.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Fitting room: We’ll have a full body mirror, but you can also ask the customer to  leave their I.D. with you while they change in UC bathroom.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>We’ll be organizing tables based on merchandise and quantity. Some of you who have smaller quantities will be sharing tables! We&#8217;ll send you a map with the set-ups in the next couple days.</span></p>
</li>
<li>Clothing vendors: We’ll be providing clothes racks, so let Hayden (hwsmith@andrew.cmu.edu) know if you need one.</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t stay for the whole time, grab a buddy to help you out!</li>
</ul><p>Those are the big points for now. <em>Please contact </em>Hayden at <span><em>hwsmith@andrew.cmu.edu</em> for questions. Stay tuned!</span></p>

			<p><span>Hi everyone!<br/></span><span>We have an exciting event coming up, hosted by the Design League for the first time - </span><em><strong><span>SUNSMASH POP-UP SHOPS</span></strong></em><span>! And we’re inviting you to be a vendor!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What is it?</strong><br/></span><span>Sunsmash is a venue for the CMU community </span><span>to share, buy, and sell creative artifacts (including food, games, music, and handmade crafts). Sunsmash Pop-Ups also supports the reuse of materials (such as with a small-scale thrift shop with clothing and student supplies), and is a showcase of the skills and interests of the students (primarily in the School of Design but not limited to) and a celebration of the hard work put into the academic year.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>When and where?</strong><br/></span><span>Friday, May 3, last day of classes from 1:00p - 4:00p! We&#8217;re planning to have it outside on CMU&#8217;s campus, on the CFA Lawn or near the UC. Location and times are to be confirmed!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>So what?</strong><br/></span><span>It’s the perfect chance to showcase your hand craft skills, and to make a little bit o’ $$$! We will have 3 main categories for Sunsmash: food, clothing, and handmade artifacts. You can sell, buy, and swap things from any category. Along with the wonderfully handmade artifacts, there will be a makeshift photo booth with props, a thrift shop, music provided by WRCT, games, italian sodas, and more! It’s just going to be a fun time. </span></p>
<p><strong>Interested in selling?</strong><br/><span>Fill out this <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jiCuDuz3doGkdfbrtBGshZgTaYGvLkQJxhdry9fa_Wc/viewform" title="Sunsmash Vendor Interest Form" target="_blank">FORM</a>.</strong> Don’t fret - if you only have a couple items to sell, you can team up with a buddy or another vendor from our list. We’ll help you get it all sorted :)</span></p>
<p><strong>What can I sell?<br/></strong><span>So many things! Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul><li>Clothes you don’t wear anymore but are in good condition</li>
<li>Screenprints, bookbinding, graphic prints, calligraphy, photographs</li>
<li>Furniture, soft goods</li>
<li>Paintings, pottery, ceramics, sculptures, glassblowing</li>
<li>Zines, illustrations, cards, postcards</li>
<li>CDs, records, books</li>
<li>Knitting, crocheting</li>
<li>Food*! baked goods, donuts, snacks</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Fine Print:</strong></p>

<ul><li>You make, you sell, you earn the money.</li>
<li>There is a $5 entrance fee for vendors</li>
<li>*If you want to sell food, you will have to take a University required online food quiz which is required for all food vendors. (It’s quick and easy).</li>
<li>Sunsmash&#8217;s purpose is to exhibit and celebrate student work. All items for sale must be handmade or original digital outputs unless the item is being repurposed.</li>
<li>Design League has a food table at Sunsmash to fundraise. If you don’t want to sell your own stuff, but would like to help out, email us for volunteering opportunities!</li>
<li>Items should be of quality. Sunsmash is a representation of the creative student body work at CMU.</li>
</ul><p><span><br/><strong>FAQ</strong><br/></span></p>

<p></p>
<p><em>Do I have to stay at my table the entire time? What if I only have a couple things to sell?</em></p>
<p>Design League is going to be grouping vendors who won&#8217;t be occupying an entire table by themselves. We&#8217;ll let you know of the groupings, and your table group can take shifts, or you can have a buddy help out.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s the deal with Design League&#8217;s food &amp; activity tables?</em></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to be a vendor, but you want to be involved, we can work together! DL is having a food and drink table, and if you want to cook something up to help bring in some money for the org, let us know. If you take this route, you&#8217;ll get reimbursed for the food you purchase and make from DL. If you don&#8217;t want to cook, you can help us with shifts at the table. Email Eunice at eschung@andrew.cmu.edu</p>
<p><em>How does the payment work?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s really up to you, but cash will be the main transaction. Some other options include using Venmo or Square.</p>

<p><strong>Tips &amp; Tricks</strong></p>
<p>Establish a pricing structure and have signs for prices! Circle stickers are perfect for clothing if you have multiple price points. </p>
<p><strong>Contact us</strong></p>
<p><span>For general inquiries:<br/><strong>Eunice</strong> <br/>eschung@andrew.cmu.edu</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Michelle</strong><br/>mguarino@andrew.cmu.edu</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be having an info session soon for interested vendors, be on the lookout!</p>

So it has been a long, long summer. 10 weeks at The Barbarian Group went by very quickly and I must admit that I was both sad and okay with leaving. There were some really rough points where I felt pretty lost, but I finished strong and learned a lot about the industry, about working with a team, and about what I enjoy the most in design.
I have to say that they have a great internship program at TBG. With an intern orientation that started with 7 others, and eventually adding 3 more interns, we had a great group of support as we felt our way through the wide world of advertising. Each of us had some trying moments, but we all made it through!
We had 2 intern projects. One was to do an audit of TBG&amp;#8217;s internal wiki and figure out who uses it, why people don&amp;#8217;t use it, what would be the best way to make it work, and if a wiki is the best way to share all of the information. It was a good way for us to talk to people in all different departments and learn more about TBG.&nbsp;
The second was working on a pro bono project for an avant&nbsp;garde art gallery. We worked on revamping their website. The strategy intern gave a presentation, then wires were worked on, and then design&amp;#8230; and then more wires and more design and more wires and a lot more wires. The project actually had a lot of problems which probably stemmed from having other employees joining and leaving throughout the project. I found most of the process to be extremely frustrating. Firstly, I have never worked on wires for a whole website. I had a lot of trouble trying focusing on the details that are the job of the user experience designer, but that I really didn&amp;#8217;t care about. For example, if you are going to have a pop up image viewer, how do you get back to the site? Is there an &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; or does it say &amp;#8220;close&amp;#8221; or does it say &amp;#8220;exit&amp;#8221; or does it say nothing and you just click outside the picture. Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t care about this sort of thing, but I HAD to care. I had to have a reason, a stance, or in internal meetings I would get slammed. Secondly, I was not used to the visual side trumping usability. There were many instances where what made sense was overruled by what one or two people suggested with no reasoning. I just tried to grow a thicker skin and not care too much.
One of the best parts was becoming a part of the Barbarian culture. I met a lot of people in the company. Up until the last day I was meeting new people. Everyone was always friendly and everyone had different interests to talk about and share. The UX department really welcomed me and helped me out. I think I was a bit of a hassle at some points, but they were always patient and I&amp;#8217;m excited to see who ends up at confluence next year.
And so after 10 weeks I got to sit in on meetings and work on projects with clients like GE, Samsung and The Kitchen. I made a lot of wires, did a lot of research, and generally learned a lot. I am not sure if UX is for me, but I guess i&amp;#8217;ll see what happens after senior year.
If anyone has any questions about The Barbarian Group, working at an advertising agency, User Experience or Visual design at an agency, or getting a TBG internship or any internship. Please email or FB me. I love to answer questions and talk.">

So it has been a long, long summer. 10 weeks at The Barbarian Group went by very quickly and I must admit that I was both sad and okay with leaving. There were some really rough points where I felt pretty lost, but I finished strong and learned a lot about the industry, about working with a team, and about what I enjoy the most in design.
I have to say that they have a great internship program at TBG. With an intern orientation that started with 7 others, and eventually adding 3 more interns, we had a great group of support as we felt our way through the wide world of advertising. Each of us had some trying moments, but we all made it through!
We had 2 intern projects. One was to do an audit of TBG&amp;#8217;s internal wiki and figure out who uses it, why people don&amp;#8217;t use it, what would be the best way to make it work, and if a wiki is the best way to share all of the information. It was a good way for us to talk to people in all different departments and learn more about TBG.&nbsp;
The second was working on a pro bono project for an avant&nbsp;garde art gallery. We worked on revamping their website. The strategy intern gave a presentation, then wires were worked on, and then design&amp;#8230; and then more wires and more design and more wires and a lot more wires. The project actually had a lot of problems which probably stemmed from having other employees joining and leaving throughout the project. I found most of the process to be extremely frustrating. Firstly, I have never worked on wires for a whole website. I had a lot of trouble trying focusing on the details that are the job of the user experience designer, but that I really didn&amp;#8217;t care about. For example, if you are going to have a pop up image viewer, how do you get back to the site? Is there an &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; or does it say &amp;#8220;close&amp;#8221; or does it say &amp;#8220;exit&amp;#8221; or does it say nothing and you just click outside the picture. Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t care about this sort of thing, but I HAD to care. I had to have a reason, a stance, or in internal meetings I would get slammed. Secondly, I was not used to the visual side trumping usability. There were many instances where what made sense was overruled by what one or two people suggested with no reasoning. I just tried to grow a thicker skin and not care too much.
One of the best parts was becoming a part of the Barbarian culture. I met a lot of people in the company. Up until the last day I was meeting new people. Everyone was always friendly and everyone had different interests to talk about and share. The UX department really welcomed me and helped me out. I think I was a bit of a hassle at some points, but they were always patient and I&amp;#8217;m excited to see who ends up at confluence next year.
And so after 10 weeks I got to sit in on meetings and work on projects with clients like GE, Samsung and The Kitchen. I made a lot of wires, did a lot of research, and generally learned a lot. I am not sure if UX is for me, but I guess i&amp;#8217;ll see what happens after senior year.

			<p>Hello everyone, I&#8217;m Sarah, a soon to be junior industrial design student, and I am the worst. Yes I&#8217;ve been living and working in San Fran for more than 2 months now and yes this is my first blog. So to reiterate, yes, I am the worst.</p>
<p>So, what have I actually been doing besides falling off he face of the tumblr-earth? I&#8217;m currently interning at <a href="http://gomiso.com" title="Miso" target="_blank">Miso</a> as a product design intern. When I first came on board, the Miso team was actually beginning a new product separate from the one that they already had established. Their previous product was an iPhone app along with a web experience that strove to create a better TV watching experience through the use of check-ins, badges, and Sideshows. Essentially, Sideshows was a feature that allowed users to relive TV moments and talk about them with others. Since I started working on the entirely new product, I can&#8217;t really do the old Miso app much justice, having limited experience with it.</p>
<p>As of now though, my day-to-day consists of helping out the team with whatever needs to be done in order to crank out this awesome new app. Often this entails helping to design user interactions and flows, visual layouts, and just lending my voice to the team when we&#8217;re brainstorming for the best possible user experience. I can&#8217;t really get too specific at this point, but when our new app launches, hopefully you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what I&#8217;ve been doing these past few months.</p>
<p>But why did I, an industrial design student, fly half way across the country to do what&#8217;s usually considered a pretty CD-heavy job? To be honest, in my search for an internship this summer, I wasn&#8217;t too picky about what I wanted to do. I just wanted to get some experience under my belt in any field even remotely design-related so I could get a real glimpse of how the actual world outside of our beloved CMU blue-foam covered studios  worked. Luckily, I was able to stumble upon something much better than a random loosely-related-to-design job here at Miso. I&#8217;ve always been interested in designing user interactions and how to design for a specific experience. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve been unable to follow through with these interests at CMU due to time constraints and all the other excuses in the world. So when the opportunity arose, I gladly jumped on this chance to learn more at a startup, an environment I heard was incredibly conducive for multi-disciplinary self-directed learning, about this rapidly growing field of web and mobile user interaction design and what the hey, why not move out to San Francisco while I&#8217;m at it?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, San Francisco is a beautiful and culturally rich city, the likes of which I&#8217;ve never experienced before. There&#8217;s a lot to see and do here, not to mention the plethora of vegan and vegetarian options (which brought tears to my eyes when I first arrived). And as wonderful as this city is, I would also like to note that it is ridiculously cold here. I figured it was the summer and being the true Chicagoan that I am, ignored the warnings of San Franciscans about the chilly summer months, writing them off as &#8220;silly Californians&#8221;, only to discover that I had to swap many of my shorts and summer gear for sweaters and scarves. So yes, San Francisco is unfortunately, at its coldest during my entire stay here. Thank god for the good food.</p>
<p>So basically, what I really wanted to say in a rather long winded borderline rant about chilly weather, is that despite my background in industrial design, I have learned so much from working here that I feel significantly more confident in my work than I did before (and definitely much more than if I had spent my summer lounging on the couch and waitressing at Ruby Tuesdays again&#8230;) So if you&#8217;re interested in anything outside of your field, don&#8217;t get too stressed worrying whether you&#8217;re not qualified enough to do it. That&#8217;s honestly my entire first week here. But as I started to really get into projects and work with such an encouraging and supportive team, I found that sometimes all you need is a designer&#8217;s brain and the rest will work itself out. Granted, there is still so much to learn and experiment with, but then again, I would be pretty upset if I moved out here and there wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Oh yes and here is a picture of San Francisco on my trek home from work. Needless to say, it was terrifying.</p>
<p><img height="484" src="http://i.imgur.com/MLgwH.jpg" width="648"/></p>
<p>But this was also soon remedied by all-you-can-buy Kettle flavored Popcorners (at Walgreens, nonetheless!) and tea service at <a href="http://samovarlife.com" title="Samovar Tea Lounge" target="_blank">Samovar Tea Lounge</a>:</p>

			<p>Hi again.</p>
<p>This past week, I was lucky enough to have a short internship with one of my idols, <a href="http://jessicahische.is/awesome/" target="_blank">Jessica Hische</a>. She is an illustrator and designer specializing in typography based in San Francisco. She is most well known for her font, <a href="http://www.jessicahische.is/lettering/herfirstfont" target="_blank">Buttermilk</a>, and more recently, designing a font specially for Wes Anderson&#8217;s new movie, <a href="http://designenvy.aiga.org/wp-content/plugins/designenvy/curator_submissions/post/4854/MOONRISE-KINGDOM-POSTER_l.jpg" target="_blank">Moonrise Kingdom</a>. She also has hundreds of pieces made up of illustrations and lettering for editorials. Working with her was  really an amazing experience, and a completely different world than my other internship at Flite (which I wrote about here.) I was able to see what it&#8217;s like to be a designer working for yourself and managing all your clients and projects alone, and what it&#8217;s like to be so involved in the Design Community.</p>
<p><img align="middle" height="500" src="http://i49.tinypic.com/33ne2z8.jpg" width="500"/></p>
<p><em>An example of Jessica&#8217;s work - The classics reimagined</em></p>
<p>My first couple days consisted of doing some of her little jobs. She is launching a new version of her portfolio site in a few weeks, so I was enlisted to tag and write all of the new URLs for each post. Check them out when she makes it public. I  had fun with that, and I got to watch her work on her client jobs, one of which was a book cover, and on her wedding invitation site which is truly creative and beautiful. </p>
<p><img align="middle" height="40" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/11lmsqt.jpg" width="400"/></p>
<p><em>Some of my rough drawings based off of the font &#8216;Trajan&#8217;</em></p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span"></span>For my last few days, Jessica focused on teaching me what I admired most about her; lettering. She had just bought a new Cintiq tablet so she was learning how to incorporate it into her process, but she taught me by teaching me the basics of typography. She put me through her workshop which involved having me study a couple of a font (she had me use Trajan) and learn all of the nuances and basic rules, and then draw the rest of the alphabet out based off of that. It was difficult at first, but soon I had figured out a lot of the rules. There is so much more to type than you realize. Much of it is based off of old printing techniques, and there are little things that reference those old times that you notice if you look closely. After that, she had me scan in my work and taught me illustrator. This went a little slowly because I had never used illustrator, but she taught me a few basic rules, such as &#8220;Don&#8217;t use too many points, but not too few either.&#8221; I have the rest of them written down if anyone is interested. By the end, I had gotten a good grasp on the software, and I was making smooth shapes. She finished up by having me trace some of her sketches for a client, and critiquing me. </p>
<p>One of the best things of the week was simply being in their studio. It&#8217;s located in the heart of the Mission district which is so different from the Financial district where my other job is. Also, Jessica shares her studio with a fellow typographic designer, <a href="http://www.erikmarinovich.com/" target="_blank">Erik Marinovich</a>. He&#8217;s one of the people behind <a href="http://friendsoftype.com/" target="_blank">Friends of Type</a>, if you&#8217;ve seen that site. He is incredibly nice and friendly, and it was so fun to be in the studio with him and his intern, <a href="http://jamestedmondson.com/" target="_blank">James Edmondson</a> (also a talented designer). Jessica and Erik work alongside each other on different projects, but compare work all of the time and ask for each others opinion. Also, they know so many amazing people, and I was able to accompany them on lunches with really cool people every day. I met a few designers from Facebook such as <a href="http://typochondriac.com/" target="_blank">this guy</a>, and the people behind <a href="http://designerfund.com/" target="_blank">this</a>. </p>
<p><img align="middle" height="500" src="http://i49.tinypic.com/1zwdbwy.jpg" width="400"/></p>
<p><em>Erik and Jessica in their studio</em></p>
<p>One of the most important things I learned during my brief time with Jessica was the importance of TECH + DESIGN. I also mentioned this in my blog post about Flite, but learning to code seems to be crucial. Jessica taught herself coding, and has done sideprojects such as Don&#8217;t Fear the Internet stressing the importance of learning how to code. Overall it was such an awesome, albeit short experience. I am really grateful for the time I got to spend with them. If you have any other questions, go ahead and shoot me an email! </p>

			<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>This week will be my fourth week at HarperCollins Publishers working as an intern in the Children&#8217;s design department in NYC. As someone who is pretty resistant to anything not-print and who has always loved reading I&#8217;ve been loving the experience so far.</p>
<p>Most of you are probably familiar with HarperCollins from books like Where the Wild Things Are and Goodnight Moon. As one of the biggest publishing companies out there, there are many imprints and departments that make up the company and the process of creating a book is a lot more complicated than I could have imagined. I work in the Children&#8217;s division which includes everything from picture books to teen novels. <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m654daSNt41qh13b4.jpg"/></p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll explain a little bit about the role of the design department. Once a book is going into production, the editor sends us a Cover Art summary, which is basically a form that says what the author would like to see. There are the questions like title, if it is part of a series, and who the target audience is as well as things like descriptions of main characters and current books they see as competition. These can also include images of books or styles they want the cover to reflect. Each book is given to an art director who then works within their team of designers to create the cover. Our department is made up of about 20 people including designers, art directors, a creative director, and freelancers. Twice a week the designers and art directors meet with the books&#8217; editors at Cover Art meetings to discuss what they have been working on so far. This could be a discussion of illustrators they are considering hiring to do the artwork, narrowing down of concept ideas, or deciding on last minute type adjustments. The editor serves as a liaison between the author and designer as well as an authority on the content and concept of the book. Once ideas become more finalized they are sent to the author for approval. </p>
<p>The space reminds me a lot of studio. We each have our own desk and there are flat files in the middle with cutting boards and X-actos for everyone to use. Everyone is really friendly and down to earth and so excited about the work they do. Someone is always telling a story or sharing ideas or talking about a new book they started reading.<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m654cfvs921qh13b4.jpg"/></p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m654a4k6Fy1qh13b4.jpg"/><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m654ayUjlq1qh13b4.jpg"/></p>
<p>One of my favorite things is sitting in on Cover Art meetings- it&#8217;s been really interesting to see what the editors choose. Sometimes there are 30 options laid out on the table for them to discuss and eliminate. There were times when the ones I thought were best were eliminated first, but so much goes into the decision that I never considered. For example, paranormal romance is really big right now so if the typeface reflects that mood it might sell better than a more futuristic choice. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been working on making sales books. These are existing books that we recover to create a preview of books that are not out yet. These are sent to stores like Target so that they can imagine how they will appear in stores and decide what books and in what quantity they want to order. If a cover doesn&#8217;t have art yet I make temporary mechanicals, which are basically simple cover layouts.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve really been enjoying working at HarperCollins. There is always something new to work on and I&#8217;ve started to get more design-related stuff to work on (including doing some hand-lettering for a title!) I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the rest of the summer goes&#8230;and getting more free books along the way!</p>
