                            <img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/91614080c734066549b821ccb8560a00/tumblr_n9fze3ZnDt1qhbm33o10_1280.jpg" alt="Vivian @ Facebook
I&rsquo;m Vivian, a rising senior in CD, and this summer, I&rsquo;m working as a product designer at Facebook. While Josie already wrote about her experiences at the New York office, I&rsquo;ll be talking about working at Facebook HQ, in Menlo Park (MPK).&nbsp;
The biggest benefit from working at MPK is the people. Most of Facebook&rsquo;s designers work out of this office, and just being able to talk to them and ask them for feedback inherently makes your work a lot better. Having the people who built the prototyping tools you&rsquo;re using at a daily basis just a short stroll away is nothing short of amazing - and people are always willing to help you out or point you to someone who can help you if you&rsquo;re having issues using any of the tools. The other interns are also a huge benefit - you&rsquo;re never without friends to eat with at the many places on campus, and you always have at least the interns to get opinions on your work from.
Facebook is my first &ldquo;big tech company,&rdquo; and my first experience building things to ship on a deadline. I work on photos in the core product, and sit in proximity with my team, which consists of my mentor, the engineer who&rsquo;s building my designs (who&rsquo;s also an intern, which is awesome), his mentor, and our PM. There are teams within teams within orgs within products, and labels can be pretty confusing at times, because at Facebook, there is an incredibly flat organizational structure. Sure, you have a &ldquo;manager&rdquo; but they serve more as your mentor and guidance figure. You are your own boss at Facebook, and you&rsquo;re expected to manage yourself and your time in whatever way you want in order to ship the best possible product. The upside of that is that Facebook is still able to move relatively fast, and individuals have the agency they need to build great things. The cost of this is feeling like you&rsquo;re working in structured chaos most of the time - you spend a lot of your time as a designer tracking down people who made design decisions that affect your project. Context is key, whether it&rsquo;s a school project or a work project, but the people who have the context that you need might have left already, or might work in another building or another office, and it&rsquo;s only by talking to others can you find out the information that you need.
That being said, I feel empowered to really affect change even as an intern. My engineer and I are the only ones working full-time on our project, and I feel like I really own my work as I haven&rsquo;t before. Like Josie has previously mentioned, Facebook does everything it can to help you succeed, but it also pushes you to take control of your internship. Your mentor and recruiter work closely with you to define goals, and then achieve them by summer&rsquo;s end. Part of this is some hand-holding in the beginning, but a lot of it is just being thrown into projects headfirst and working at full blast right away. There is no &ldquo;intern project&rdquo; because here, they trust you to do real work.&nbsp;
Of course, it&rsquo;s not always work. Actually, you might even say we have too much fun here at Facebook. We have intern trips out to places like Muir Woods, Cal Academy of Sciences, Giants games, and Santa Cruz. I marched in the SF Pride parade for the first time - or more accurately, danced down Market St behind a giant Facebook float and screamed myself hoarse. My larger team, the Photos team, had an offsite one day where we learned how to cook paella and then eat it. I even got to work at the NYC office for a week, and while I was there, the design interns and their managers had an offsite where we got drinks and played shuffleboard, which was a great way to relax, have fun, and reconnect with the NYC interns. I spend most of non-working time on the MPK campus with Abby, grabbing lunch at Fuki Sushi or Harvest (we have nine places on campus to eat for lunch, it&rsquo;s great), or getting coffee at Philz - and then getting dessert at the Sweet Stop. There&rsquo;s the Analog Lab, where you can screen print posters and learn brush lettering. There&rsquo;s a woodshop, where you learn how to cut pens from wood. We have an arcade room in case you need more distraction, a gym with rock climbing, and campus bikes in case you need to get from one building to another faster than your feet can take you. Facebook really takes care of you, so that you can focus your energy on producing great work. You&rsquo;ll definitely need that energy, because the problems here are as complex as they come, but hey: work hard, play harder.&nbsp;">

I spend most of non-working time on the MPK campus with Abby, grabbing lunch at Fuki Sushi or Harvest (we have nine places on campus to eat for lunch, it&rsquo;s great), or getting coffee at Philz - and then getting dessert at the Sweet Stop. There&rsquo;s the Analog Lab, where you can screen print posters and learn brush lettering. There&rsquo;s a woodshop, where you learn how to cut pens from wood. We have an arcade room in case you need more distraction, a gym with rock climbing, and campus bikes in case you need to get from one building to another faster than your feet can take you. Facebook really takes care of you, so that you can focus your energy on producing great work. You&rsquo;ll definitely need that energy, because the problems here are as complex as they come, but hey: work hard, play harder.&nbsp;">

I&rsquo;m Vivian, a rising senior in CD, and this summer, I&rsquo;m working as a product designer at Facebook. While Josie already wrote about her experiences at the New York office, I&rsquo;ll be talking about working at Facebook HQ, in Menlo Park (MPK).&nbsp;
The biggest benefit from working at MPK is the people. Most of Facebook&rsquo;s designers work out of this office, and just being able to talk to them and ask them for feedback inherently makes your work a lot better. Having the people who built the prototyping tools you&rsquo;re using at a daily basis just a short stroll away is nothing short of amazing - and people are always willing to help you out or point you to someone who can help you if you&rsquo;re having issues using any of the tools. The other interns are also a huge benefit - you&rsquo;re never without friends to eat with at the many places on campus, and you always have at least the interns to get opinions on your work from.
Facebook is my first &ldquo;big tech company,&rdquo; and my first experience building things to ship on a deadline. I work on photos in the core product, and sit in proximity with my team, which consists of my mentor, the engineer who&rsquo;s building my designs (who&rsquo;s also an intern, which is awesome), his mentor, and our PM. There are teams within teams within orgs within products, and labels can be pretty confusing at times, because at Facebook, there is an incredibly flat organizational structure. Sure, you have a &ldquo;manager&rdquo; but they serve more as your mentor and guidance figure. You are your own boss at Facebook, and you&rsquo;re expected to manage yourself and your time in whatever way you want in order to ship the best possible product. The upside of that is that Facebook is still able to move relatively fast, and individuals have the agency they need to build great things. The cost of this is feeling like you&rsquo;re working in structured chaos most of the time - you spend a lot of your time as a designer tracking down people who made design decisions that affect your project. Context is key, whether it&rsquo;s a school project or a work project, but the people who have the context that you need might have left already, or might work in another building or another office, and it&rsquo;s only by talking to others can you find out the information that you need.
That being said, I feel empowered to really affect change even as an intern. My engineer and I are the only ones working full-time on our project, and I feel like I really own my work as I haven&rsquo;t before. Like Josie has previously mentioned, Facebook does everything it can to help you succeed, but it also pushes you to take control of your internship. Your mentor and recruiter work closely with you to define goals, and then achieve them by summer&rsquo;s end. Part of this is some hand-holding in the beginning, but a lot of it is just being thrown into projects headfirst and working at full blast right away. There is no &ldquo;intern project&rdquo; because here, they trust you to do real work.&nbsp;
Of course, it&rsquo;s not always work. Actually, you might even say we have too much fun here at Facebook. We have intern trips out to places like Muir Woods, Cal Academy of Sciences, Giants games, and Santa Cruz. I marched in the SF Pride parade for the first time - or more accurately, danced down Market St behind a giant Facebook float and screamed myself hoarse.

I even got to work at the NYC office for a week, and while I was there, the design interns and their managers had an offsite where we got drinks and played shuffleboard, which was a great way to relax, have fun, and reconnect with the NYC interns. I spend most of non-working time on the MPK campus with Abby, grabbing lunch at Fuki Sushi or Harvest (we have nine places on campus to eat for lunch, it&rsquo;s great), or getting coffee at Philz - and then getting dessert at the Sweet Stop. There&rsquo;s the Analog Lab, where you can screen print posters and learn brush lettering. There&rsquo;s a woodshop, where you learn how to cut pens from wood. We have an arcade room in case you need more distraction, a gym with rock climbing, and campus bikes in case you need to get from one building to another faster than your feet can take you. Facebook really takes care of you, so that you can focus your energy on producing great work. You&rsquo;ll definitely need that energy, because the problems here are as complex as they come, but hey: work hard, play harder.&nbsp;">

                        <h1>Vivian @ Facebook</h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m Vivian, a rising senior in CD, and this summer, I’m working as a product designer at Facebook. While Josie already wrote about her experiences at the New York office, I’ll be talking about working at Facebook HQ, in Menlo Park (MPK). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><span class="s1">The biggest benefit from working at MPK is the people. Most of Facebook’s designers work out of this office, and just being able to talk to them and ask them for feedback inherently makes your work a lot better. Having the people who built the prototyping tools you’re using at a daily basis just a short stroll away is nothing short of amazing - and people are always willing to help you out or point you to someone who can help you if you’re having issues using any of the tools. The other interns are also a huge benefit - you’re never without friends to eat with at the many places on campus, and you always have at least the interns to get opinions on your work from.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>Facebook is my first “big tech company,” and my first experience building things to ship on a deadline. I work on photos in the core product, and sit in proximity with my team, which consists of my mentor, the engineer who’s building my designs (who’s also an intern, which is awesome), his mentor, and our PM. There are teams within teams within orgs within products, and labels can be pretty confusing at times, because at Facebook, there is an incredibly flat organizational structure. Sure, you have a “manager” but they serve more as your mentor and guidance figure. You are your own boss at Facebook, and you’re expected to manage yourself and your time in whatever way you want in order to ship the best possible product. The upside of that is that Facebook is still able to move relatively fast, and individuals have the agency they need to build great things. The cost of this is feeling like you’re working in structured chaos most of the time - you spend a lot of your time as a designer tracking down people who made design decisions that affect your project. Context is key, whether it’s a school project or a work project, but the people who have the context that you need might have left already, or might work in another building or another office, and it’s only by talking to others can you find out the information that you need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That being said, I feel empowered to really affect change even as an intern. My engineer and I are the only ones working full-time on our project, and I feel like I really own my work as I haven’t before. Like Josie has previously mentioned, Facebook does everything it can to help you succeed, but it also pushes you to take control of your internship. Your mentor and recruiter work closely with you to define goals, and then achieve them by summer’s end. Part of this is some hand-holding in the beginning, but a lot of it is just being thrown into projects headfirst and working at full blast right away. There is no “intern project” because here, they trust you to do real work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, it’s not always work. Actually, you might even say we have too much fun here at Facebook. We have intern trips out to places like Muir Woods, Cal Academy of Sciences, Giants games, and Santa Cruz. I marched in the SF Pride parade for the first time - or more accurately, danced down Market St behind a giant Facebook float and screamed myself hoarse. My larger team, the Photos team, had an offsite one day where we learned how to cook paella and then eat it.

                <h1><a href="http://cmudesignleague.tumblr.com/post/93784884552/gene-palantir">Gene @ Palantir </a></h1>

            </header>
















            <p>Hey! I&#8217;m Gene, a junior ID &amp; HCI student. I&#8217;m currently seven weeks into being a product design intern at Palantir Technologies. So far, it&#8217;s been a blast.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/246b1add1d5993bb624c69f4a4a2d397/tumblr_inline_n9oy0jL7Rg1qahzc5.jpg"/></p>

<p>A lot of people (myself included basically until I started) have trouble figuring out what Palantir does, which is understandable – the company makes data analysis software for governments and large businesses, something the average consumer isn&#8217;t necessarily concerned with. In a nutshell, Palantir makes a suite of data analysis applications: geospatial &#8220;Google Maps&#8221; tools to locate and plot data on a map, web-diagram-like graphs to visualize money flow for fraud prevention, or Excel-on-steroids advanced spreadsheet software. Think of Palantir being to data analysts, what Adobe is to creative professionals.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/7464fed6993607b7102822031f7d6c14/tumblr_inline_n9oy10SJV91qahzc5.jpg"/></p>

<p>Much of my time is spent in the design lab, a spacious office with lots of natural light. Palantir spreads itself throughout multiple buildings downtown Palo Alto, and the result is a refreshing lack of &#8216;campus&#8217;-ness that accompanies some of the bigger tech companies in town, although this seems to be something of an uphill battle to maintain as the company gets bigger and needs more space. In the meantime, we enjoy the benefits of a medium-sized company (good in-house food, strong internal support infrastructure) but remain integrated with some semblance of the real world.</p>
<p>The design presence at Palantir definitely benefits from the growth the company has been seeing. I&#8217;ve been told that designers have doubled in number since last summer, and even though the team is fairly new, (2-3 years) product design is generally treated as a parallel to engineering rather than a nicety further down the pipeline. The team is still growing, and being able to be part of the company at this time and shape what design might be like in the future is a very exciting prospect.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/94e6657a9c12419910e037ceea8601a7/tumblr_inline_n9oy2sYGAz1qahzc5.jpg"/></p>
<p>In my case, I work on a product called Case Management, something initially used only at the Los Angeles Police Department to help them track criminal investigations. Palantir is currently moving away from an application tailored specifically to LAPD to a product that can be applied to a range of other agencies that manage investigative cases. Essentially, the product is starting from scratch – and for five weeks, I was the only designer on this product, given the trust to make overarching design decisions that would define how the product worked, how it looked, and how effective it would be to use.</p>
<p>For a while, I floundered a bit in existential crisis at the intimidating task, but with plenty of guidance from a quality mentor (&#8220;You&#8217;re out of your comfort zone? Good, I&#8217;d be worried if you weren&#8217;t&#8221;), I received an excellent field-learning crash course in interaction &amp; visual design, in communicating effectively with engineers, and in regularly presenting my work and articulating design decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/2cbd8699ee85857bc066551c48db5542/tumblr_inline_n9oy3088f81qahzc5.jpg"/></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/4d5007ec3beaa59be1c256ee9ee34a33/tumblr_inline_n9oy3tYRK61qahzc5.jpg"/></p>

<p>There are a couple other things I appreciate about interning here, besides the work I&#8217;m doing. Design is constantly discussed informally (the broad sweeping field in general, or just in the form of links to pretty websites) – everyone is passionate about what they do and the growth of one another as designers, even outside of specific projects. On a company-wide level, Palantir&#8217;s work by nature is applied to issues with real gravity to them (cyber-security, disease control, criminal justice), meaning that there&#8217;s a kind of mission-driven culture that I believe to be increasingly rare in the Silicon Valley. There&#8217;s a motivation in knowing that the work we do affects people in very tangible ways.</p>
<p>The three weeks I have left will be devoted to cracking down on the nitty-gritty of one of Case Management&#8217;s core functions, working closely with the front-end developers and the new designer put on the project to bring what is currently diagrams and screen mockups to a living, usable application. The time will also be devoted to consuming large quantities of the steady supply of green tea Pocky.</p>

            </header>
















            <p>This summer I&#8217;m a Product Design Intern at Facebook, and I have a pretty unorthodox FB internship experience: I am based in the NYC office (instead of at Facebook&#8217;s headquarters), I work on something that&#8217;s not part of the core Facebook product, and I worked out of the London office for part of the summer.</p>

<p>I think I got a pretty sweet deal.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/b211edf39855c4a3f1fc222354d15b6d/tumblr_inline_n90ta6azHB1qivagy.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Facebook flew me out to Menlo Park for the first two weeks for design bootcamp, and then flew me out to London again in the beginning of July because our whole team decided to work from that office. So I&#8217;ve had quite a bit of traveling with this internship.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/2dc4f63c281d2675824e117a02fcaf2e/tumblr_inline_n90qmbopO81qivagy.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>The best part about being in the NYC office is being in the city. Whereas the Menlo Park campus is filled with cafes and restaurants and fun and games, the FBNY office is sort of like a shelter from the hustle and bustle of the city. In Menlo Park, teams don&#8217;t really go &#8220;out&#8221; for lunch or dinner. They go to one of the many food places on campus. But here, it feels like we have lunches and dinners and drinks every week&#8212;out in all the best locations in New York.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/7514b1f409c9c1476269e1a0b898d40b/tumblr_inline_n90ty33BOq1qivagy.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>I got a similar feeling from the London office, too. The office itself is a lot shinier and nicer, though, as seems to be the case with everything in London. For the two weeks, our team stayed in a war room, which is a conference room set up with desks and monitors so visiting people can have a place to sit and so the team can all be in the same location.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/52b31086b30bee8802466fbc61d64f27/tumblr_inline_n90ug4kghJ1qivagy.jpg" alt=""/><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/944fee350e71a2fad8a2740227b6fdf2/tumblr_inline_n90ujgj2mi1qivagy.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>My team moves pretty fast in working, especially because we&#8217;re not part of the core Facebook product. We actually just pushed something out last week for internal dogfooding (meaning for other Facebook employees to use and test and give feedback) and it was really interesting to see the kind of feedback people gave, and to be part of the process of refining our work based on that feedback. I&#8217;ve never had that experience previously because nothing that I&#8217;ve worked on during an internship has been launched before the internship ended, and it&#8217;s definitely not the kind of thing that class projects allow you to experience either.</p>

<p>My favorite thing about working at Facebook is that they really support your growth as a designer. In the words of my roommate, they &#8216;do everything to help you succeed.&#8217; Nowhere else have I experienced this kind of trust and support&#8212;they let you present your work to stakeholders, they trust your design judgment when a decision needs to be made, and they let you work on important projects that get released. In addition to all that, they give you valuable feedback as you go, not just on your design work, but on how you can be a better designer.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/ab0feefb313c706bf460b1cabb5aa3ae/tumblr_inline_n90pkgYAd21qivagy.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Something that&#8217;s been really valuable to me during this internship is all the high-level product discussions that I get to participate in. It&#8217;s difficult, and different, to think about design in terms of product strategy and it&#8217;s really helpful to hear all the intelligent opinions and perspectives everyone has. People really get worked up about these decisions sometimes.</p>

<p>I knew before coming to Facebook that they had a number of exceptional designers. I can now sort of see how they got there&#8212;the company definitely not only spawns and grows great products, but also fosters the growth of people. Over the past summers I slowly realized the importance of a good mentor, and it&#8217;s really amazing seeing how my mentor/manager this summer helps me become a better designer (oh, and he&#8217;s a CMU alum!). It&#8217;s not just him, either. I get an indirect sense of what his manager is like because we have a lot of crits and discussions together, and it confirms the fact that Facebook cultivates people. Good mentors and good designers.</p>

            </header>
















            <p>Hi design peeps,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/f85b3a1feb25342e69a624a2bd2445d7/tumblr_inline_mqkcq58HTF1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s Sequence&#8217;s SF office.</em></p>
<p>I’m Sahana Kumar. I’m a rising junior in Communication Design. I am the Visual Design Intern at <a href="http://www.sequence.com" target="_blank">Sequence</a>, an awesome design firm in Potrero hill in San Francisco.  It is relatively small with two offices in NYC and SF. I am lucky enough to be their second intern ever in their SF office!</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/7b82d930d7ea6f76594bc0a501d161a1/tumblr_inline_mqkfztqahy1qz4rgp.png"/></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m immortalized on their wall! That&#8217;s me, bottom left corner.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My internship is actually almost over, but I’ve had an amazing time. Sequence’s approach to design is called “Experience Design”. They aim to take a brand beyond the traditional identity and into an immersive experience that is consistent across many mediums. They work very hard at this and are great at what they do. Because of this, they have a ton of impressive clients, like Chipotle, Peets, LeapMotion, Food Network and Apple to name a few.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Being an intern here has been invaluable. I’ve been on a variety of projects, and have been responsible for tiny parts of a project or client presentations. They’ve treated me like a designer and taken me seriously and I really appreciate that. I’ve learned a lot about working with clients in mind, and about the design process. This has been interesting because I can compare it to how I would work at school.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One thing that we’ve been doing a lot of at CMU is working on collaboration and group projects. This has been a bit tough for me to get used to, because it is always less complicated to take on a project solo. However as I am learning, that is not how the real world works, and working in a team is a skill that will get you far. At Sequence, a designer or two will be grouped with a copywriter, sometimes a strategist or motion designer or UX designer, and topped off with a project manager. Each person is responsible for a part of the final product, and they brainstorm and consult each other every step of the way. Brainstorming is huge here. I’ve been invited to brainstorms from other groups so they can get fresh opinions, and held sessions for my own projects. I really like working on a team now. The end product feels comprehensive in every aspect because of all the different people who have worked on it and contributed their own expertise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’ve worked on a few projects that are confidential, but one of the ones that I can talk about was for Chipotle. I was approached by the New York office to help design some icons for their 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary <a href="https://chipotle.promo.eprize.com/20th/" target="_blank">Adventurrito</a> contest. It was my first time designing icons and I learned a lot. Apart from that, I’ve worked on projects for lots of other clients too. I collect assets, create mockups, and work on presentations. I’ve had a great experience working with the various clients and all the different people on each team.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/bfb20aa93eec130690e74ca1b3f6bde3/tumblr_inline_mqkg7k97QX1qz4rgp.png"/></p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s Adventurrito! </em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sequence is also great because of the culture. Everyone is so open and willing to chat. My internship program included regularly scheduled informative interviews with the different types of people in the office. I got to sit down with Strategists, Project Managers, and Copywriters for half an hour and learn about what they do at Sequence, and how they got there. It’s interesting to get to know people I may not otherwise work directly with.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We’ve done some things all together, like an office outing to a Giants Game, and a creative offsite, which was easily my favorite day of my entire internship. We all gathered at the Golden Gate Club in the Presidio and discussed how Sequence can improve, but also did some really goofy and fun activities. One of these was a Create-Thon which involved us having 30 minutes to come up with a product for a random and goofy audience, technology, and service drawn out of a hat. My group won third place :) and I proudly wore my plastic bronze medal for the rest of the night (which involved an outing to an awesome gastropub, the Tipsy Pig). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/9956c9f5635fb584680b544b97f5a3b6/tumblr_inline_mqkg1zVvHD1qz4rgp.png"/></p>
<p><em>The creative team at the Tipsy Pig after our Offsite. Creds to Cindy Tsui</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our 8th Anniversary Party was the day before I left and it was a great way to finish off my internship. All of our clients showed up, and other designers in the area. On my last day, they threw me a goodbye party complete with boxes full of Chipotle burritos. I can&#8217;t believe that two and a half months have flown by so fast. I&#8217;ll miss them a lot.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/b6a2b23699daee59dd83c7afb1d45361/tumblr_inline_mqkgix3cXb1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Snippets of the food from the goodbye party. Yummy.</em></p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s it! If you have any questions feel free to ask me. I&#8217;ll be off to Switzerland in a week to study for a semester in St. Gallen, so see you guys in January! </p>

            <p>'Twas an exciting day for me at Sennheiser. Our much anticipated Form Labs Stereolithography Printer arrived. Really sweet piece of equipment. We backed the project on kickstarter and finally got it and unboxed it today. Can't wait to get it setup next week and try it out!</p>

<p>Expect some 3D partporn in the next couple weeks!</p>

<p>As promised: Here are the first parts printed in clear acrylic. I let it run overnight so I&#8217;m not sure how long the job took. The machine runs really nicely, the beam of UV light is steered around a bath of uncured arcrylic by articulating mirrors instead of moving along x y and z axis with stepping motors, so its absolutely silent. Its hard to tell because of all the support structure, but the 0.05mm resolution is fantastic. The parts took an hour of xacto and sandpaper work.</p>

            <p>Hi Brajes and Brajettes (see Workaholics for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCPWQLryt-Q" target="_blank">pronunciation</a>)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m Josh Newby, a soon-to-be Senior in Industrial Design at Carnegie Mellon. I&#8217;ve spent my summer working at The Sennheiser Innovation and Technology lab in San Francisco. </p>

<p>The Innovation and Tech office is a branch of the German company, <a href="http://en-us.sennheiser.com/" target="_blank">Sennheiser Co.</a> We&#8217;re made up of myself, and 12 engineers. Our workplace is a quiet, but spacious office in Portrero Hill, between a super-delicious coffee truck, and a hella-bueno taco place. I get my bean water from the coffee truck every morning and my bean blankets from the taco place for lunch. </p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/e436911689d54a96f8c199503c65d8cc/tumblr_inline_mq2m8t09jm1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>



<p>I commute to and from San Francisco by Caltrain, its about 45 minutes in each direction. It was cool at first, but tacking on about 2 hours to each work day gets old quickly. Fortunately Caltrain has an open container policy that I have been happily exercising on my way home.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/6c0f931286ecf05c95c70ef5fd4927d3/tumblr_inline_mq2o9sRUII1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>



<p>The Sennheiser Innovation and Tech lab is responsible for pushing the envelope of audio technology. Nothing we work on here is consumer-level. We are tasked with pursuing new technologies in audio perfection. The projects we work on are probably 5-10 years ahead of any existing products, and a large portion of what we do is aimed at research, or professional grade applications. Some technologies developed here find their way onto shelves, but usually quite a few years down the line. Needless to say I can&#8217;t talk specifically about the project I was given, but let your imagination wander when I say: the projects here are REALLY FUCKING COOL. </p>

<p>The reason I found myself in a Tech office with 12 engineers is because a few months ago a couple of them had an idea for a project that required extensive mechanical design, prototyping, and human factors considerations. They&#8217;re all electrical and audio engineering nerds, and they wanted someone more mechanically inclined to design and develop the idea.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a couple parts I made that won&#8217;t give away too much :P</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/b5fec00212387b7e2c74c0d7d893b279/tumblr_inline_mq2oahcSLF1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p></p>

<p>On my first day, I was invited into the conference room where Sebastian, my project manager, explained in about 5 minutes the idea they had conceived. After 5 minutes, and a couple slides showing some data they had collected, he basically said: &#8220;Go do it. Try to have it done by the end of your internship.&#8221;</p>

<p>That project is what I have been working on for 7 weeks now, with a few breaks to listen to dank tunage in the listening room. It&#8217;s extremely rewarding to completely own a project of this magnitude from start to finish. I have made some really exciting progress on it, and I&#8217;ve impressed the shit out of myself with how much I&#8217;ve learned and created in just a short time. </p>

<p>If all goes according to plan, my project will be taken to Germany and presented at the Innovation summit, in the Fall. I feel tremendously accomplished knowing that I am actually developing a technology that hasn&#8217;t been explored before.</p>

<p>I wish I could tell yins more, but in the mean time, check out our listening room.<span> </span><span>I listened to a couple of my all time favorite albums in here and it was like hearing music for the first time. I literally shed a tear listing to Port of Morrow.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/79cf3ec08f19bf7d2fa6de908c473cd1/tumblr_inline_mq1xck1DRw1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p><span>Fluid is digital design agency that has been around since 1998. They&#8217;re still relatively small, about 120 employees across 3 offices including Chicago and New York. Fluid works with clients to design anything that lives behind a screen, but they also design and develop their own digital products which they can then license to other companies. Fluid has been a leader in the eCommerce business and is responsible for shaping many aspects of the online shopping experience. They have recently completed projects with The North Face, Levi&#8217;s, and Google.</span><span> </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span>I&#8217;m currently working on Fluid&#8217;s first ever pro-bono project redesigning a website for a non-profit organization in Somalia called Abaarso School of Science and Technology. They are an outstanding college preparatory school who recently graduated their first class! Despite their incredible success, they need more teachers, donations, and publicity in order to continue the work they do. I happened to join Fluid right as the project began so I was lucky enough to work closely with the Strategy team to conduct research, create content, and other front end development. I am currently working with the Experience Design team and the Visual Design team to actually develop the website for launch by the end of this month. Later on we get to work with videographers in Somalia to storyboard videos for the website. It&#8217;s all super exciting stuff and we, of course, work closely with the founder of Abaarso to make sure that the work we do is on par with what the school needs.</span><span> </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span>I guess I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect but despite the fact that my title includes the word &#8220;intern&#8221; I have been given a great deal of input on these projects. My opinions and research are valued and considered, my work is presented to clients, it must be of a certain standard, and it&#8217;s used to move the project forward. This can be intimidating to know that you have solid deadlines, that you&#8217;re doing work you&#8217;ve never done before, and that people are counting on you to do well. But, I am fortunate enough to have my team sitting all around me, all of them incredibly helpful and friendly and by the end of the first week, I felt I had a solid handle on things.</span><span> </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/7fd9f86f4f1f337f49f4d8cf58c8d9ff/tumblr_inline_mq1xg3fEsU1qz4rgp.jpg"/></span></p>

<p><span>All this being said, my daily routine includes waking up at 7 and commuting to work via bus for an hour every morning. When I get to the office (after a delicious morning espresso of course) my day typically includes team meetings, brainstorming sessions, sketching, wire framing, writing, or research. I&#8217;m working with an intern in New York on project for the Product team so I will often call in to collaborate with her via Google Hangout.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/e873cc2c2d6f8ecb702c899d7a16eb4a/tumblr_inline_mq1xfe2xNR1qz4rgp.jpg"/></span></p>

<p><span>The office environment is super relaxed and it&#8217;s the type of environment you come to expect from a design firm. We have social events a couple times a week, people bring in their dogs, we host small parties, we drink, we go to lunch, etc. Everyone in the office has been incredibly personable and they&#8217;re as tight as any of our studios. Of course, San Francisco itself is awesome. Amazing food, cool stores, beautiful parks, concerts, museums, lots of design firms to visit. It&#8217;s a vibrant city but it never feels overwhelming or congested. It&#8217;s also incredibly bike friendly and navigable (so bring one if you can).</span><span> </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/3a1badfb6b89106a26bf03f81c11c607/tumblr_inline_mq1xubfPLq1qz4rgp.jpg"/><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/71230a1e01dbeab2acd11ea0550d8fa4/tumblr_inline_mq1xurwaw71qz4rgp.jpg"/></span></p>

<p><span>So, despite the fact that I study Industrial Design, there is a lot of overlap between the disciplines. Most of what I have learned studying ID directly applies to UX. I have found that UX design is not more or less interesting than ID, it&#8217;s simply different, and it&#8217;s a field which I have really come to appreciate. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span>There are also unlimited raw almonds in the kitchen, which is a HUGE deal. I consider that free healthcare.</span><span> </span></p>

            </header>
















            <p>Oh heeeeeey fellow designerds! Fancy seeing you here.</p>

<p>My name is Maggie and I&#8217;m going to be a senior (eek.) in Communication Design &amp; Human-Computer Interaction NEXT MONTH. WHAT. Well, now that I&#8217;ve officially terrified myself, I thought I&#8217;d pipe in about what I&#8217;m up to this summer and how it&#8217;s going.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working at this tiny little company that you&#8217;ve probably never heard of called Apple. I work on the iTunes Apps Design team on a website called iTunes Connect. It&#8217;s what distributors and developers use to sell their content on iTunes and the App store. While I can&#8217;t say much of anything about my projects because, well, it&#8217;s Apple, I would love to speak to some of the things I&#8217;ve been enjoying.</p>

<p>The first thing is something I learned from CMU. As part of my job, I&#8217;ve had to meet and discuss products with engineers. There were discussions about load time, efficiency, and other fancy engineering technical speak. But the really great part? Because of my experience working with engineers at school, and really because of my computer science related coursework, I actually understood a good half of what they were saying. I actually was able to contribute to these conversations without feeling like that lowly intern that has no idea what she&#8217;s talking about. And it was awesome. </p>

<p><strong>tldr;</strong> go take a computer science class.</p>

<p>Thus far, I&#8217;m enjoying the ride! Next time, I&#8217;ll try and talk about how this summer is a major contrast to last summer with the internship I had, where I lived, and the environment I worked in. :)</p>

            <p>In the coming weeks, as we have done previous years, students from the School of Design will be posting about their summer internships here. Dozens of design students from CMU are interning at a range of companies as diverse as Apple, Cooper, Facebook, Google, IBM, Landor Associates, Microsoft, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, R/GA, and Sennheiser, and will be reflecting on their experiences here in words and images</p>
